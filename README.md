# myBashScripts

This is a collection of the bash scripts I've written to automate various tasks. I've spent hours to automate these tasks that would've taken minutes, with no regrets, but maybe you can use them to help make them even more worth it in the long run!

1) Shrinkage - takes a nested directory of files and runs all of the *.mp4 files through ffmpeg in order to reduce their file size. Feel free to adopt the parameters or shoot me a questions about the the looping for "find ... -exec "
